## Codebase map

- `apps/web` — React UI. Email reading: `ThreadView.tsx`, `MessageBody.tsx`
  (sandboxed srcdoc iframe), `message.css`; settings in `Settings.tsx`; demo
  seeds in `data.ts`.
- `packages/inbox-sdk` — SDK + server. Sanitization lives only in
  `server/sanitize.ts`; Gmail MIME decoding in `server/sdk/gmail.ts`; core
  sync/policy in `src/core.ts`; tests in `tests/`.
- `apps/local-host` — local host process; `apps/mock-api` — mock provider.

## Current app baseline

All work, whether local or on GitHub, must use the latest intended application
baseline. An up-to-date remote branch is not sufficient when the user's local
app is newer; a newer checkout does not prove the running app serves that build.

1. Before implementation or review, inspect the working tree, fetch the relevant
   remote refs, check merged PRs, and compare local and remote history. Identify
   the running service and served build when relevant. Preserve concurrent work;
   do not assume `origin/main`, a retained worktree, or an old fixture is current.
2. Resolve baseline differences before proceeding. Preserve the latest applicable
   app changes, including layout, interactions and settings. Do not silently use
   an older public UI to keep a patch isolated. If the current baseline cannot be
   reproduced safely, stop and ask for the integration/publishing decision. This
   rule does not authorize publishing unrelated local commits, merging unapproved
   features, discarding edits, or deploying work in progress.
3. Develop and verify against that current baseline. If an isolated public PR
   must use a different base, also maintain a current-app integration of the exact
   patch and disclose both revisions. Checks against the older PR base alone do
   not qualify the change for the app the user actually uses.
4. Capture before/after UI evidence from the current-app baseline and that same
   baseline plus the proposed change, using fictional mail. Match the user's
   layout, theme, density and relevant settings; keep fixture state, viewport,
   zoom and build mode identical between captures. Inspect the rendered result
   and verify the loaded assets. Do not present an older UI or fresh-profile
   defaults as representative, even for a backend-only patch that changes visible
   output. Label integration evidence accurately rather than implying it is the
   standalone public PR build.
5. Recheck refs, concurrent changes and build identity before requesting approval,
   merging or deploying. If relevant code or UI changed, update the integration
   and affected evidence/checks before proceeding. Existing PR evidence from a
   stale UI must be refreshed before it is used for approval or deployment.

## Commands

- Always run bun with `--no-env-file`.
- Verify with: `bun --no-env-file run typecheck && bun --no-env-file run build`,
  `bun --no-env-file run test:web`, and
  `INBOX_TEST_LIVE=false bun --no-env-file run test:api`.
- The dev stack is managed by `scripts/dev.ts`; running services and their
  PIDs/logs are listed in `data/runtime/services.json`. Check it before
  starting servers; do not spawn duplicates.

## Data and privacy

- `*.sqlite` files contain real mail. Open them read-only, never print message
  bodies or credentials, and never commit them. `data/`, `superlocal.local.json`,
  and `apps/web/reference/` are gitignored and must stay out of history.
- Screenshots or dumps that may show real mail go under `data/qa/<topic>/`
  (chmod 700), never into git or handoff text.

## Email renderer invariants

- Email HTML renders only inside the isolated, scriptless srcdoc iframe in
  `apps/web/src/MessageBody.tsx`; never inject email HTML into the app DOM.
- Sanitization happens once, server-side, in `packages/inbox-sdk/server/sanitize.ts`;
  do not add client-side re-sanitization or global CSS overrides for email content.
- Keep the SDK remote-image/tracking policy and the Settings UI description in
  sync; verify both sides when changing either.

## Performance contract

- Ordinary mail events reconcile through bounded SDK deltas, not full-mailbox
  scans. Full inventories are for bootstrap and explicit recovery/scope changes.
  Do not hide stale-cursor failures, increase retries, or weaken ownership and
  revision fences to make a benchmark pass.
- Read/star/body updates rebuild only affected source/thread identities. A valid
  cached open performs no body request and publishes no replacement mail model.
  Unaffected conversations retain their object identities. Body/media policy,
  scope and content changes must still invalidate the appropriate cache.
- Done/W/Undo complete from durable, conditional receipts, not a full refresh or
  provider settlement. Keep captured membership scope, newer intents and later
  replies safe. Pending is not failed, and queued mail is not sent mail.
- Keep virtualized render inputs bounded (`getWindow`, `getHighlighted`, and
  sender-conversation accessors), rather than passing full render-entry/mail
  graphs to leaf components. Compile predicates once per selection pass, use
  indexed/set lookups for bulk selection, and reuse formatters/indexes with
  correct immutable-data, scope and clock invalidation.
- Normal use and acceptance measurements use `bun --no-env-file run start`
  (optimized local UI), with timing logs enabled. `dev` is for HMR development;
  development-only timings are not release evidence. Logging must stay bounded,
  content-free and off the action's critical path.

Reference acceptance budgets on comparable local hardware, with mail already
cached in SQLite:

| Scenario | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Cached open, at both ~6.5k and 50k messages | 100ms |
| E/W completion, at both sizes | 150ms |
| Fresh navigation to usable inbox, ~6.5k–10k messages | 1.5s |
| Fresh navigation to usable inbox, 50k messages | 4s |

These are measured acceptance targets, not brittle wall-clock unit assertions.
For changes to queries, reconciliation, caching, selectors, virtualization or
rendering, run the relevant existing regressions and compare base/head in the
same optimized build mode, fixture state, viewport and environment. Record
revision, fixture seed/counts (canonical messages versus projected rows), browser
and runtime versions, hardware, logging state, cache/warmup conditions, and at
least five action samples with median/p95/max. Report first body load, cached
open, frame estimates, animation duration, and startup separately. Include
concurrent arrivals/actions: an idle empty inbox is not a scale test.

Use the existing fictional mock/SDK setup; do not depend on one developer's
private database or temporary fixture path. If an old fixture is unavailable,
recreate a fictional equivalent and measure both base and head against the same
dataset. Never lower dataset size, drop checks, raise budgets, or disable logging
merely to obtain a pass. A budget/contract change needs explicit user approval
and recorded evidence. Extend the existing two SDK/four web test files only;
new test files, frameworks and CI are not authorized by this policy. Do not run
unchanged expensive suites twice or benchmark documentation-only edits.

The SDK-backed case in `apps/web/tests/mail-model.test.ts` guards cached opening,
incremental updates, E/W/Undo and unaffected identities. The bounded-read and
receipt cases in `packages/inbox-sdk/tests/api.test.ts` guard paging, cache
validators, ownership and concurrency. Preserve these behavioral checks, not
merely their names or the existence of test files.

## UIPRs

A **UIPR** is required for any change that can affect visible UI or interaction:
layout, styling, copy, loading/empty/error states, focus, keyboard/pointer behavior,
motion, virtualization, or email rendering. A backend/sanitizer change that alters
the rendered result also qualifies, even if no CSS file changes.

1. Before editing UI, establish the **current app baseline** above, identify the
   review base, affected scenarios and expected differences. Capture the **before**
   state from that current baseline using fictional mail in an isolated profile.
   Load `personal-design` as required.
2. Open a **draft PR titled `UIPR: <scope>`** on an isolated review branch before
   implementation; a baseline-evidence-only initial commit is allowed if needed
   to open the draft. Use `.github/pull_request_template.md`. If permissions or a
   safe base are unavailable, stop and ask—do not bypass the UIPR requirement.
3. Implement on that branch and capture matching **after** evidence. Use screenshots
   for static changes and screen recordings for interaction, loading, scrolling
   or animation changes. Match fixture state, viewport, zoom, theme and density;
   label the base/head revisions. Exercise relevant edge states, not only the
   happy path. A saved media file is not proof: inspect it and verify the outcome.
4. Put reviewable before/after media links or embeds in the PR, with expected
   differences, correctness checks, and performance evidence when relevant.
   A local `data/qa/` path, missing baseline, broken link, or uninspected capture
   does not satisfy the requirement. Only approved fictional media may be
   published; never upload real mail, even blurred/redacted, credentials, private
   browser chrome, or raw private logs.
5. Keep the PR draft until evidence and required checks are complete. Obtain
   user/designated-reviewer approval before merge or deployment; agents do not
   self-approve or auto-merge. Fix unexpected UI differences, or obtain a documented
   exception before proceeding. Non-UI-only PRs explain why visual evidence is N/A.

UIPRs do not authorize publishing unrelated work. Inspect the branch/base diff
before pushing: local `main` may contain unpublished commits that must not hitch
a ride. If the requested UI change cannot be isolated safely, ask for the base
and publishing decision before implementation. Do not push `main`, rewrite
history, upload private evidence, or sweep other work into the PR. These are
mandatory agent/review rules and test checks, not configured GitHub branch
protection; do not claim automatic remote enforcement or add CI without approval.

## Browser QA

- Use read-only browser-control sessions named `superlocal-*`; delete them when
  the audit ends. Shard large mail-corpus audits across parallel browser-qa
  subagents by thread index.
- If a subagent cannot load a skill (permission denied), that is not a blocker
  for a read-only audit: proceed with the audit and note the denial in the report.

## Git history

- Commit each completed, verified feature change or bug fix as a focused change.
  Explain what changed, why, removed/replaced behavior, and verification in the
  commit message; include the commit hash in the handoff.
- The coordinating agent owns commits in a shared checkout. Subagents report
  their exact changed files and checks; do not concurrently stage or commit.
- Stage only the files or hunks belonging to that change and inspect the staged
  diff. Never include unrelated work, credentials, private configuration, runtime
  data, real email content, or private screenshots/logs. Do not push or rewrite
  history unless explicitly requested.
